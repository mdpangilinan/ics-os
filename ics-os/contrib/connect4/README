Connect-Four Game for ICS-OS
Author: Pangilinan, Moesha Dane D.P.

--------------------------------

1.	Go to file/s directory.
	$cd contrib/<folderName>

2. 	While in file directory, use scripts to compile and build.
	Running chmod ONCE is enough unless you make a change in the .sh file.
	Choose from either of the two, or do both.
	I.
		$chmod +x compile.sh			//for COMPILING
		$chmod +x build.sh				//for BUILDING and RUNNING ICS-OS
	II.
		$chmod +x sample.sh				//for COMPILING AND BUILDING

3. Run scripts in the terminal.
	I.	./compile.sh					//COMPILE before BUILDING for
		./build.sh						//changes to be applied
	II.
		./sample.sh						//use only when code is FINISHED
		//will not show COMPILATION ERROR should there be any
		//in the case of a compilation error, the last COMPILED file will be used.
										
3. Run <fileName>.exe inside ics-os

Enjoy!
